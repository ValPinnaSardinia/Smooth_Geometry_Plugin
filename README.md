Version 1.2.0

Smooth Geometry Tool allows you to smooth selected vector geometries directly in QGIS. A configuration dialog lets you control the smoothing behaviour using iterations, offset, minimum distance, and maximum angle, making it suitable for cartographic refinement and data cleaning workflows.

This plugin smooths the selected geometries. A configuration dialog permits to change the smoothing settings (iterations, offset, minimumDistance and maxAngle).

Suggested default starting configuration: 

Iterations = 1
Offset = 0.3
MinimumDistance = -1
MaxAngle = 180

QGIS Minimum Version = 3.0
QGIS Maximum Version = 4.99
Supports Qt6 = True
